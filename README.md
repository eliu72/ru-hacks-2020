## Product Description 

  Ever since COVID-19 has blown up, the necessity of online presence has been crucial for our world to stay connected on both large scale (corporations, companies, etc.) and on a small scale (schools, classes, etc.) which has put a reliance on online platforms for meetings. While online meetings are not ideal in many situations, it has become a necessity for many to utilize these platforms as efficient as possible but can still be very difficult to get the same quality and experience as in-person meetings.

  This is why our team was passionate about improving peoples online meetings by assisting them through automatic note taking. Users will be able to record audio through the microphone of a call that will be analyzed and will create notes of the voice recordings of important information brought up in the meeting.
